There goes my anxiety of knowing Tina & seeing her, Facebooked her and seen 10-15 Tina Dsouza... Pheww, then had to narrow down my search & look for specific details that aunty gave, & there I go I see a red dress beautiful looking East Indian girl on Fb. That night was difficult to sleep thinking about Tina..</p><br/><p>Next day, 24th Jan 10.30am it was time to call her Dad, Stephen Dsouza. At first when I called I coz uncle's name & my second name matches. Uncle asked me questions & he told me about Tina, I asked for her picture as I wasn't able to find her, after receiving her picture I sent her a Facebook request, which she accepted & then we started talking… I spoke to her for the first time on 25th Jan Saturday, called her around 3pm & spoke to her. Felt nice that day & the chatting's n talking didn't end since that day.</p><br/><p>Now, it was time to meet up for the first time on 27th Jan, we both work at Goregaon & was easy for to drop at her office & meet her, trust me it wasn't an easy task. I still vividly remember that moment thinking that she would be taller to me even after scanning all her pics on fb. There she comes from her office building, n I see her I was just thanking God for her height & wow lightning struck me...... I was mesmerized... What a beauty!!! Our first meeting & we both loved it, I was doing more of talking & looking at her & Tina was just feeling shy to look in the face & talk, I then left for work at & later asked her if she felt ok... and I guessed it right she was super shy...</p><br/><p>That week we did meet a couple of times before work & talked for a while & then it was time to ask her out for a date on Saturday 1st February & propose to her officially....... Aaaaahhhhh wait a sec that was too long, It was 30th Jan 12.04am where I proposed to Tina... N her response was that she was waiting to hear this... Wow she proposed me too & there it was an official proposal done.</p><br/><p>I Met her parents on 1st February & her mom asked me now say... N I told aunty we like each other & surprisingly they asked Tina & it was only then she told her parents that she liked me that was crazy feeling...</p><br/><p>At once aunty asked me for wedding date & I was so dam happy, we then decided our big day on 20th Dec 2014 n we also fixed our engagement day on 1st Mar... that was ONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE.......</p><br/><p>And from there our never ending journey began...</p> </div> <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> </div> </div> </div></div><div class="modal fade" id="meetGroom" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="meetGroomLabel" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-header"> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span><span class="sr-only">Close</span></button> <h4 class="modal-title" id="meetGroomLabel">How I Met Leeon</h4> </div> <div class="modal-body"> <br/><p class="text-center"><img src="images/how-we-met-1.jpg" alt="Leeon & Tina" title="" class="couple-pic" /></p><br/> <p>I mailed him my picture from my mom's id & wrote to him as my mom would :P</p><br/><p>He sent me a friend request, I accepted it, we spoke to each other via chat.</p><br/><p>We exchanged numbers & began chatting, what began then is never ending now…</p><br/><p>We started talking like we knew each other for a very long time, late night chats led to sparks of love between the two of us. One find day Leeon just dropped by near my office & that's when we met for the very 1st time. I was a little skeptical for the meet as I was meeting someone without my family & it was pretty visible as I was very quiet & shy too... I barely spoke anything to him… but that meet was an unforgettable one for both of us...</p><br/><p>I wouldn't say it was love at first sight, but we were definitely a couple at first sight. That night when we spoke, he suddenly popped up the question "Would you like to spend the rest of your life with me?" My heart beat rose & I said "YES" that's when we proposed to each other. Leeon met my parents on 1st February, till then I hadn't told my family that we had proposed to each other; all they knew was I was talking to him & needed time to take my decision...</p><br/><p>My mom asked Leeon so what do you'll intend to do? And Leeon was surprised, that I hadn't told anything at home, that's when I gave my consent to my parents that I intend marrying Leeon. The appiness that I seen on my parents face added to my joy.</p><br/><p>Our official 1st date after telling our family was at R city Mall, where we sat at coffee shop trying to know each other & our families. While he dropped me back home, we were fortunate to seek blessings from Sisters from Mother Teresa's Ashram they had come to visit our home. They blessed us & prayed over us, it was an amazing feeling of being blessed!!! But that wasn't all, the blessings continued untill the next day...</p><br/><p>It was exam time, where I was to go to Leeon's place & meet his family pheww!! All nervous as it could be… but it went out all smooth…his parents also liked me & we both decided to pay a visit to Mount Mary Bandra to thank God for the gift of each other.</p><br/><p>While we were praying, I met a family priest who was on visit there; I introduced him to Leeon & Fr. Was very happy for both of us & blessed us, and to my surprise Fr. knew Leeon as they came from the same place. Thus we began our journey seeking blessings!!!</p><br/><p>And here we are two souls with but a single thought two hearts that beat as one!</p> </div> <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> </div> </div> </div></div><script src="js/jquery-1.11.0.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="js/countdown.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="js/custom.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="js/jquery.fancybox.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="js/bootstrap.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function(){$(".fancybox").fancybox();$(".fancybox-effects-a").fancybox({helpers:{title:{type:"outside"},overlay:{speedOut:0}}});$(".fancybox-effects-b").fancybox({openEffect:"none",closeEffect:"none",helpers:{title:{type:"over"}}});$(".fancybox-effects-c").fancybox({wrapCSS:"fancybox-custom",closeClick:true,openEffect:"none",helpers:{title:{type:"inside"},overlay:{css:{background:"rgba(238,238,238,0.85)"}}}});$(".fancybox-effects-d").fancybox({padding:0,openEffect:"elastic",openSpeed:150,closeEffect:"elastic",closeSpeed:150,closeClick:true,helpers:{overlay:null}})})</script></body></html>
